# Notes on development

For this project I opted to push myself to not use any UI libraries and manually write css.  I utilizied react query and axios for api calls.

I also utilized the get device by id endpoint even though it wasn't in requirements because it felt wrong to not include it.

# Startup instructions
# Start the api server

Open the app in your terminal
$ cd devicesTask_serverApp 
$ npm i
$ npm run start

# Start the dev server

Open a second terminal and navigate to the app
$ cd ninjaui
$ npm i
$ npm run start

Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:3006/
