# Notes on development

For this project I opted to push myself to not use any UI libraries and manually write css.  I utilizied react query and axios for api calls.
I also utilized the get device by id endpoint even though it wasn't in requirements because it felt wrong to not include it.

## Start the dev server

Open a second terminal and navigate to the app \
$ cd ninjaui \
$ npm i \
$ npm run start

Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:3006/
